Pixel Reader and zoom using OpenCV
For static zoom, the working is straightforward and self explanatory â€“ run the program, an image will be captured and displayed. You can use the ROI selector to pick the region you want to zoom into and hit enter. Both the original and the zoomed image will be displayed and can be closed by pressing 0.
For dynamic zoom, a picture will be taken, after which you can pick a region. You can then hit 1 to zoom in further, or 0 to stop and see the pixel values. It is to be noted that the values of point of intersection of lines of the ROI selector overlapping the image will have its pixel values displayed. For any other point you can simply click on the image to display. (to see all the points use the mouse to scroll and zoom in)
